		<h1>Chapter 3: Crumbling Over Her</h1>
		<p>As broken pieces of the ceramic plate shattered on the ground, Helen looked on numbly. She had been feeling hopeless ever since Alan Chang had firmly ended their relationship.

		<p>***

		<p>Dr. Ankistar listened intently as Helen sat in the therapist's chair.

		<p>"I will never forget that night in the closet." Tears flowed from Helen's eyes, and Dr. Ankistar checked his watch. The time was up and he really needed to meet a stupid slut he had been talking to.

		<p>"Looks like it's time," Dr. Ankistar said. "Here's prescriptions for prednisone, cialis, and melanin injections to get over the mental anguish Ms. Kim."

		<p>As Helen rose from the chair, she collapsed immediately.

		<p>"Nurse! Call the ambulance!" 

		<p>***

		<p>At Soi Cowboy Park, the couple held hands. "Everybody thinks we're a couple now." Alan said.

		<p>Tumbling smiled and her eyes brightened. "You know, I've always had this gut feeling."

		<p>"What do you mean?"

		<p>"Dunno."

		<p>Alan contemplated what she meant. "You know... doesn't it bother you?" Lately, Alan had been unsure over the sudden trajectory of his life. He liked Tumbling, but he wondered if they were moving too fast.

		<p><i>BRRRNG-BRRRNG! BRRRNG-BRRNG!</i> Alan's phone was ringing. <i>BRRRNG-BRRRNNG!</i>

		<p>"Alan Chang!" It was Michael Cao on the other line. "We finally have enough in our budget to get you an intern at AIDS Corp! Do you know of anybody who would be interested?"

		<p>As Alan got the news, Tumbling locked eyes with him, and for a moment he was ready to ask her to be his intern. However, still battling his inner demons of inceldom, he was unsure if he was ready for that.

		<p>***

		<p>When Helen woke up, she was all alone and hooked onto a ventilator. The doctors had been unsure whether or not she would make it. By chance, a male nurse named Harke walked into the room and was stunned to see her awake.

		<p>"Oh my God," Harke said, "The little rat bastard woke up!"

		<p>"How long have I been here...?"

		<p>"Two weeks." Harke felt Helen's forehead. "What do you remember? Tell me your address now."

		<p><i>Two weeks</i>, Helen thought. Tears rolled down her face. For some reason, she could only think of Alan Chang. "I miss him so much."

		<p>***

		<p>It was early in the morning when Alan Chang heard knocking at his door. 

		<p>"Don't go," Tumbling said. She rolled onto his side of the bed to hug him. "Let them knock."

		<p>"I have to at least check. Don't worry Tumbling, I'll be back."

		<p>When Alan Chang opened up his front door, he saw Sexpat Shaq. "You check Helen," Shaq said. "She fight brain cancer. Big pain. She in SAD Hospital."

		<p>It was true that Alan had ended things with Helen... but with her in this state, he knew that she needed to see him immediately. "Shaq, can you take care of Tumbling for me?"

		<p>"I look." Shaq slapped his ass. And with that, Alan was on his way to Helen.
