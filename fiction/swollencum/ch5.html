		<h1>Chapter 5: Jebediah's Retribution</h1>
		<p>In the heart of the all-white town next to the University, a
			lone Involuntary Celibate man named Jebediah attended a party. There,
			he tried to fornicate with several of the white female attendants,
			only to be spurred at every opportunity. He returned home after the
			denials and looked in front of a mirror.
		<p>In front of him, he saw an ugly creature unworthy of love. But
			perhaps there was still hope. "Maybe those Stacies rejected me
			because of my race," Jebediah thought, "Maybe if I was with girls who
			were my race, I would have a chance!"
		<p>The next day while on campus, Jebediah saw a flyer which read
			"AIDS: Meetup Party!"
		<p>***
		<p>Having expected to meet many Asian Baby Girls, Jebediah was
			disappointed to find absolutely no one at the AIDS meetup. There was
			nothing in the meetup room but empty tables and a pitcher where you
			could pour yourself a drink.
		<p>Jebediah was about to leave, when suddenly, a girl walked into
			the room and towards the pitcher. The incel then promptly ran to
			greet her.
		<p>"Hello," Jebediah said, "How are you?"
		<p>Maka was planning to grab a drink for Ferguson when she had been
			approached. "Oh, hey. You're our first tonight. We thought we
			wouldn't get anyone after our last meetup featured the murder of a
			pedophile, so we're starting to clean up, but it's nice to meet you."
		
		<p>"Hello," Jebediah said, "I want to have sex."
		<p>"Uhh," Maka squirmed, "This is just an AIDS meetup. Nobody has
			sex at these things."
		<p>"Hello. You're a young woman." Jebediah stared at Maka. "I want
			to have sex with young women. They won't let me. Ok, fine. I'll rape
			and murder them."
		<p>***
		<p>Ferguson was still in the kitchen cleaning up when he heard it.
			BAAAAANG.
		<p>When Ferguson rushed into the hallway, he heard it again.
			BAAAAAAANG.
		<p>"MAKA!" Ferguson yelled, "DID YOU JUST CUM!"
		<p>BAAAAAAANG! BAAAAAANG! BAAAAAANG!
		<p>As Ferguson followed the noise around a corner, a hooded
			Jebediah ran past him. When he turned the corner, he found Maka in
			the event room, surrounded by a pool of her blood. "MAKAAAA! MAKAAAA!
			NOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"</p>
