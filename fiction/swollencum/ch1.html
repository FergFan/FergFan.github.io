			<h1>Chapter 1: An Auspicious Meeting</h1>
			<p>It was the first day of the semester, Maka had woken up late for her Asian-American History class and was rushing down the street.
			Across the crosswalk she flew. <i>SCREEEEEEECH!</i>
			</p>
			
			<p>"Stupid fucking idiot!" the driver yelled, taking off his sunglasses. His name was Ferguson.</p>
			<p>"Sorry," Maka exhaled, "I'm late and-"</p>
			<p>"Watch where your going! I almost hit you!"</p>
			<p>"Fine, but I could tell you were looking at your phone while driving. You're a reckless driver."</p>
			<p>Ferguson's eyes grew large. "Call me whatever you want, you have a shit ton of assumptions about me but you don't know me anybetter then a stranger on the street does!"
			<p>They stayed arguing for a few moments more before they went on their own way.</p>
			<p>***</p>
			<p>Maka had registered for Professor Hur's class because she had read his passionate articles about the Asian-American struggle. Now, being in the same room as him, she felt it hard 
			 to even breathe.</p>
			<p>Professor Hur warned the students, "I expect you to do your readings. Or don't even come." He ran his fingers through his two-block haircut and the girls in the room swooned. 
			"Before we continue, introduce yourself to the person sitting behind you. Community is important."</p>
			<p>Maka turned around and was shocked to see a familar face with sunglasses on. It was Ferguson.</p>
